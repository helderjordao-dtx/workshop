# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [Unreleased]

Keep an Unreleased section at the top to track upcoming changes.

This serves two purposes:
  * People can see what changes they might expect in upcoming releases
  * At release time, you can move the Unreleased section changes into a new release version section

Types of changes:
  * `Added` - for new features.
  * `Changed` - for changes in existing functionality.
  * `Deprecated` - for soon-to-be removed features.
  * `Removed` - for now removed features.
  * `Fixed` - for any bug fixes.
  * `Security` - in case of vulnerabilities.
  
 Follow those types of changes, and their order, to provide a description of precisely what notable changes have been made between each release of the project.
